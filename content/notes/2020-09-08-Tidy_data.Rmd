Introduces the idea of **tidy data**.

```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval=TRUE)
```

# The meaning of *tidy*

The tidyverse is so named because of its focus on *tidy data*. Wickham and Grolemund explain the meaning of tidy [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), but the essence is this:

* Data sets are in stored in a 2-D table. In R, they should be in a data frame.
* Each variable is in its own column.
* Each observation is in its own row.
* Each value has its own cell.


This is mostly not how people tend to think about formatting data. In Excel, we often spread a single variable across multiple columns. Imagine we were tracking the height of children over time. We might make an Excel worksheet like this:



```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
grade <- 1:4
Clara <- c(121, 127, 135, 141)
Jamal <- c(115, 121, 126, 132)
Stephanie <- c(112, 117, 123, 129)
height_data <- data.frame(grade, Clara, Jamal, Stephanie)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
height_data
```


This format makes it easy to make a timeseries plot like so:

However, these data are not tidy, because the variable of *height* is distributed across three columns. Additionally, some data - the names of the children - are encoded in the column names rather than in a column. 

We refer to data formatted this way as *wide*. We can use the **tidyr** package (part of the tidyverse) to *pivot* the data to a *long* format like so:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
height_data_long <- height_data %>% # we talk about the meaning of %>% in 'pipes'
  pivot_longer(cols = -grade, names_to = "name", values_to = "height.cm")
```

We can read this 'code sentence' as 

1. "Take the `height_data` data frame, pass it as the first argument to the `pivot_wider()` function 
2. The columns to pivot are all except `grade`, we want to call the new column to identify the children "name" and the column with the data "height.cm"
3. Finally assign the result to `height_data_long`. 

We end up with a data frame that looks like this^[Note that when we used `pivot_wider()`, which is a tidyverse function, our data frame becomes a tibble, and it is displayed slightly differently - we get information about the data type of each vector.]:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(height_data_long)
```

Tidy! The three variables in this data set are `grade`, `name`, and `height.cm`. We can also say that this data set is 'long' compared to the first data set. 

## Human vs machine readibility

For me, it is tougher to read the data from a tidy, long-format data frame than an Excel-style wider data frame. However, it is much easier to understand the contents of a tidy data frame. You can tell what the data are like just by looking at the column names, since they contain everything we know about the data set. 

# Split-apply-combine and tidy data

The other major reason to use tidy data is that it facilitates the **split-apply-combine** approach to data analysis. This approach is described in [Wickham 2011](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01). The basic idea is that virtually every statistical analysis involves the three following steps:

1. **splitting** a dataset up into parts
2. **applying** some kind of transformation
3. **combining** the results of that transformation

For instance, imagine that we want to measure the growth rate of the children in the data set above. We would want to split the data into a data set for each child, apply the transformation of determining the rate of growth, and then combining the results into a data set of growth rates. 

Tidy data frames make this splitting operation easy: we simply tell R to *split* the data according to the `name` column, *apply* the "calculate slope" transformation, and *combine* the data into a new data frame.

The beauty of this approach is that we can plug in literally any calculation or set of calculations at the *apply* step. We'll talk more later about how we can do this in R, but for now I want you to think about:

* What the data you work with would look like in tidy format, and
* What transformations would you apply to get the kinds of answers you need?
